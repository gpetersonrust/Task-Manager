Version Control with Git
Description
This repository contains a guide on how to set up version control using Git for your project. Version control is essential for tracking changes to your codebase, collaborating with others, and maintaining a history of your project's development. By following the steps below, you'll be able to initialize a Git repository, create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control, and make your initial commit.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Git: Download and install Git
Steps
1. Initialize a Git Repository
To start using Git for version control, you need to initialize a new Git repository in your project folder. To do this, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder, and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
git init
This command will create a hidden .git directory in your project folder, which contains all the necessary files and data for version control.

2. Create a .gitignore File
In every project, there are certain files and folders that you don't want to include in version control, such as temporary files, logs, and dependencies. To ensure that these files are not tracked by Git, you should create a .gitignore file. Open a text editor in your project folder and create a new file named .gitignore.

Add the names of the files and folders you want to exclude to the .gitignore file. For example:

Copy code
node_modules/
build/
logs/
Save the file and make sure it is in the root of your project directory.

3. Add Project Files to the Repository
After creating the .gitignore file, it's time to add your project files to the Git repository. To do this, run the following command in your project folder:

bash
Copy code
git add .
This command stages all the files in your project folder for the next commit. If there are files you don't want to include in version control (as specified in the .gitignore file), they will be automatically excluded.

4. Make the Initial Commit
Once you've added your project files to the staging area, it's time to make your initial commit. A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It's a good practice to provide a meaningful commit message to describe the changes you're making.

Run the following command to make the initial commit:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Replace "Initial commit" with a brief description of what this commit represents. For example, if this is the initial setup of your project, you could use "Initial project setup" as the commit message.

Congratulations! You've now set up version control for your project using Git. You can continue to use git add, git commit, and other Git commands to track changes to your project over time.
