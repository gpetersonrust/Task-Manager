# Task Manager Application with DevOps

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a task manager application using Node.js, Express, EJS, Prisma, and AWS with a DevOps approach.

## Project Setup

1. **Create a new folder for your task manager project and navigate to it.**

   Before starting any coding, it's essential to organize your project in a dedicated folder. Choose an appropriate name for your task manager project and create a new directory/folder for it. You can use the command line or a file explorer to create the folder. After creating the folder, navigate to it using the command line or terminal.

   Example (command line):
   ```
   mkdir task-manager-app
   cd task-manager-app
   ```

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project using npm init and follow the prompts to set up your package.json.**

   The package.json file holds various metadata related to your Node.js project, including its name, version, dependencies, and other configuration details. It also allows you to manage your project's dependencies easily.

   To initialize a new Node.js project, you can use the `npm init` command. This command will prompt you to enter some information about your project, such as the project name, version, description, entry point (typically index.js), author, license, etc. You can choose to accept the default values by pressing Enter or provide your own values.

   Example (command line):
   ```
   npm init
   ```

   Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information for your project.

3. **Install necessary dependencies such as Express, EJS, Prisma, and other required packages using npm install.**

   Dependencies are external packages that your project relies on to function correctly. In this step, you'll install the necessary dependencies, such as Express, EJS, Prisma, and any other packages required for your task manager application.

   The `npm install` command is used to install dependencies listed in your package.json file. It will read the dependencies from the "dependencies" section of package.json and download and install them in a node_modules folder within your project directory.

   Example (command line):
   ```
   npm install express ejs prisma
   ```

   Here, we are installing three packages: Express, EJS, and Prisma. The `--save` flag is not needed in recent versions of npm, as it automatically adds the dependencies to package.json.

   After running this command, you'll see that the required packages are installed in the node_modules folder.

With the "Project Setup" step completed, you have created a dedicated project folder, initialized a new Node.js project, and installed the necessary dependencies. This sets the foundation for building your task manager application using the specified technologies. You can now move on to the next steps to set up Express, EJS, Prisma, and other components of the application.
