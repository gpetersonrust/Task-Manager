# Task Manager Application with DevOps

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a task manager application using Node.js, Express, EJS, Prisma, and AWS with a DevOps approach.

## Project Setup

1. **Create a new folder for your task manager project and navigate to it.**

   Before starting any coding, it's essential to organize your project in a dedicated folder. Choose an appropriate name for your task manager project and create a new directory/folder for it. You can use the command line or a file explorer to create the folder. After creating the folder, navigate to it using the command line or terminal.

   Example (command line):
   ```bash
   mkdir task-manager-app
   cd task-manager-app
   ```

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init` and follow the prompts to set up your `package.json`.**

   The `package.json` file holds various metadata related to your Node.js project, including its name, version, dependencies, and other configuration details. It also allows you to manage your project's dependencies easily.

   To initialize a new Node.js project, you can use the `npm init` command. This command will prompt you to enter some information about your project, such as the project name, version, description, entry point (typically `index.js`), author, license, etc. You can choose to accept the default values by pressing Enter or provide your own values.

   Example (command line):
   ```bash
   npm init
   ```

   Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information for your project.

3. **Install necessary dependencies such as Express, EJS, Prisma, and other required packages using `npm install`.**

   Dependencies are external packages that your project relies on to function correctly. In this step, you'll install the necessary dependencies, such as Express, EJS, Prisma, and any other packages required for your task manager application.

   The `npm install` command is used to install dependencies listed in your `package.json` file. It will read the dependencies from the `"dependencies"` section of `package.json` and download and install them in a `node_modules` folder within your project directory.

   Example (command line):
   ```bash
   npm install express ejs prisma
   ```

   Here, we are installing three packages: Express, EJS, and Prisma. The `--save` flag is not needed in recent versions of npm, as it automatically adds the dependencies to `package.json`.

4. **Create an `app.js` or `index.js` file to set up your Express application.**

   Decide whether you want to use the filename `app.js` or `index.js` for your entry point. This file will serve as the starting point for your Express application. You can create the file using a code editor or the command line.

   Example (index.js):
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
   const app = express();

   // Parse JSON and form data
   app.use(bodyParser.json());
   app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

   // Set the view engine to EJS
   app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

   // Set the directory for views (if not in the default 'views' folder)
   // const path = require('path');
   // app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'your-views-folder'));

   // Route to display tasks
   app.get('/tasks', (req, res) => {
     // Your logic to fetch tasks from the database and render the view
   });

   // Route to add a new task
   app.post('/tasks', (req, res) => {
     // Your logic to add a new task to the database
   });

   // Route to mark a task as completed
   app.put('/tasks/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Your logic to update the task status in the database
   });

   //  listen for requests
   app.listen(3002, () => {
     console.log("Server is listening on port 3002");
   });
   ```

5. **Install EJS as a dependency using `npm install ejs`.**

   EJS is available as an npm package, and you can install it by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install ejs
   ```

   After the installation is complete, EJS will be added to the `dependencies` in your `package.json` file.

6. **Create a folder named `views` in your project directory.**

   EJS templates are typically stored in a folder named `views`. This folder will hold all the template files that generate the dynamic content for your application.

   You can create the `views` folder using a code editor or the command line.

   Example (command line):

   ```bash
   mkdir views
   ```

7. **Within the `views` folder, create EJS templates for displaying the list of tasks and adding new tasks.**

   EJS templates have the `.ejs` file extension. You can create separate EJS templates for different views, such as displaying the list of tasks and adding new tasks.

   Example (views/tasks.ejs):

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Task Manager - Tasks</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Task List</h1>
       <ul>
           <% tasks.forEach(task => { %>
               <li><%= task.title %></li>
           <% }); %>
       </ul>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Example (views/addTask.ejs):

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Task Manager - Add Task</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Add New Task</h1>
       <form action="/tasks" method="post">
           <label for="title">Task Title:</label>
           <input type="text" name="title" id="title">
           <button type="submit">Add Task</button>
       </form>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   In the examples above, we have created two EJS templates: `tasks.ejs` for displaying the list of tasks and `addTask.ejs` for adding new tasks. These templates contain embedded JavaScript code (denoted by `<% %>` and `<%= %>`), allowing us to loop through tasks and dynamically display their titles.

8. **Install Prisma as a development dependency using `npm install prisma --save-dev`.**

   Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database access in Node.js applications. It enables you to interact with your database using a type-safe API.

   To install Prisma, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install prisma --save-dev
   ```

   The `--save-dev` flag ensures that Prisma is added as a development dependency in your `package.json` file.

9. **Configure your Prisma data model in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.**

   The `prisma/schema.prisma` file is where you define your database schema, including data models and their

 properties. Prisma uses this schema to generate the necessary database queries.

   You can create the `prisma` folder and the `schema.prisma` file manually. Here's an example of defining a `Task` model with properties like `title`, `description`, and `status`:

   ```prisma
   // prisma/schema.prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "sqlite"
     url      = "file:./dev.db"
   }

   model Task {
     id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     title       String
     description String?
     status      String   @default("INCOMPLETE")
   }
   ```

   In this example, we have defined a `Task` model with an auto-incrementing `id`, a `title` of type `String`, an optional `description` of type `String`, and a `status` of type `String` with a default value of "INCOMPLETE".

10. **Run `npx prisma generate` to generate the Prisma client.**

    The Prisma client is a type-safe database client that Prisma generates based on your data model definition in `prisma/schema.prisma`. It enables you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your database using JavaScript/TypeScript.

    After defining the data model in `schema.prisma`, you need to generate the Prisma client using the following command:

    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```

    The `npx` command runs the Prisma CLI (Command-Line Interface) locally without the need to install it globally. The `prisma generate` command reads the `schema.prisma` file, connects to your database, and generates the Prisma client in the `node_modules/@prisma/client` directory.

    With the Prisma client generated, you can now import and use it in your application to interact with the database.

11. **Set up Prisma Studio (optional).**

    Prisma Studio is a graphical user interface that allows you to interact with your database, view data, and make changes visually. It's a useful tool for inspecting your data during development.

    To set up Prisma Studio, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx prisma studio
    ```

    This will open Prisma Studio in your default web browser, allowing you to explore your database schema and data visually.

With the "Prisma Setup" step completed, you have installed Prisma, defined your database schema, generated the Prisma client, and optionally set up Prisma Studio for database exploration. The next steps will involve setting up a database and integrating Prisma with your Node.js application to perform database operations.
